# Car Detail Page Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The Next.js frontend was showing a 404 page when clicking on cars in the catalog, even though the API was returning data successfully in the console.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was in the `transformApiResponse` function in `src/lib/hooks.ts`, which was throwing an error and breaking all SWR-based data fetching. This caused the car detail page to fail loading and show a 404 error.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/hooks.ts`

- **Fixed `transformApiResponse` function**: Changed from throwing an error to simply returning the value as-is
- **Cleaned up debug logging**: Removed development console.log statements
- **Improved SWR configuration**: Added proper error handling in the useStokMobil hook

### 2. `src/components/car/car-detail-page.tsx`

- **Improved error handling**: Distinguished between actual 404 errors and other errors
- **Enhanced error messages**: Show user-friendly error messages instead of always redirecting to 404
- **Cleaned up debug logging**: Removed development console.log statements
- **Confirmed SWR integration**: Ensured proper data fetching using the useStokMobil hook

### 3. `src/lib/api.ts`

- **Cleaned up debug logging**: Removed development console.log statements
- **Maintained functionality**: Preserved all existing API functionality without changes

### 4. `src/app/mobil/[slug]/page.tsx`

- **Verified routing logic**: Confirmed that slug extraction and stockId parsing work correctly
- **No changes needed**: The routing was already working properly

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed SWR Data Fetching**: The `transformApiResponse` function now properly returns data instead of throwing errors
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Car detail page now shows appropriate error messages instead of always showing 404
3. **Cleaned Production Code**: Removed all debug console.log statements for production readiness
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features continue to work as expected

## Testing Verification

- ✅ Frontend development server runs without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ SWR hooks function correctly
- ✅ API endpoints respond properly
- ✅ Car detail page routing works as intended
- ✅ Error handling is appropriate and user-friendly

## Result

The car detail page now loads correctly when accessed from the catalog. Users can click on any car in the catalog and see the full car details without encountering 404 errors.

## URLs and Ports

- Frontend: http://localhost:3003
- Backend API: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/admin
- Car detail URLs follow pattern: `/mobil/{carSlug}-stock-{stockId}`

## Next Steps

The bug has been fully resolved and the application is ready for production. No further action is required for this specific issue.
